This module maintains relations between company specific records (think accounts, journals) of parent and child companies, enabling users to configure things in the parent company and then copy (=cascade) this configuration to child companies.

Originally conceived for financial hosting, this mechanism is useful for any setting where Odoo is used to manage multiple organizations that have a very similar financial configuration, but organizational units are a bad fit because the companies are different (legal) entities, or just need more independence from the parent company than OUs provide.
