Create at least one config entry in *Accounting/Reporting/Hashashevet* for MOVIN and HESHIN export files.

For both types, first select an example move to use for previewing the results of your expression. Then fill in a condition that identifies this type of move exactly.

Now fill in expressions for the remaining fields, be sure to pay attention to the examples listed below each expression, and possible error messages in red. Note that you might want to export multiple lines per move, this is supported - just create configuration with the same condition, but different output.

When content with the preview values for your example move(s), save your configuration, and start an export.
