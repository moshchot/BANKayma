This module maintains relations between company specific records (think accounts, journals) of parent and child companies, enabling users to configure things in the parent company and then copy (=cascade) this configuration to child companies.

Originally conceived for financial hosting, this mechanism is useful for any setting where Odoo is used to manage multiple organizations that have a very similar financial configuration, but organizational units are a bad fit because the companies are different (legal) entities, or just need more independence from the parent company than OUs provide.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to an account/journal/etc in your parent company
#. Click Actions/Cascade to child companies
#. If not existing yet, an equivalent record will be created in the child company
#. If an equivalent record exists already, it will be overwritten with the parent company's values
